OUT OF DATE!

Tue Aug 31 13:08:53 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kimageshop_config.cc,h:
	cleaned up some stuff,
	
	added type Blending, an enumeration of all available blendings (should
	this go into some kisglobal.h?)
	
	* widgets/blendchooser.cc,h: 
	Added class BlendChooser, a QComboBox offering all available blendings
	of KIS.

	* dialogs/gradientdlg.cc (GradientDialog): 
	make use of the new BlendChooser

	* dialogs/newdialog.cc (NewDialog): 
	made OK be the defaultButton
	removed two warnings

Wed Aug 25 23:46:20 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kimageshop_config.cc (getNewConfig): 
	small API change, always use static method getNewConfig() to
	create an instance of KImageShopConfig

	Made the DialogConfigClasses set the right KConfig group before
	calling BaseKFDClass::loadSettings()/saveSettings()

Wed Aug 25 12:43:00 1999  Michael Koch  <koch@kde.org>

        * kimageshop_config.cc,h:
        Added new class BaseKFDConfig
        It saves and restores the state and position of a KFD.
        All dialog config classes should be derived from it and
        call the constructor of BaseKFDConfig with a title. This
        title is used as group name in the config file. Furthermore
        loadConfig() and saveConfig() have to call first the same
        methods of BaseKFDConfig.

Tue Aug 24 23:35:15 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kimageshop_config.cc,h:
	Added global configuration classes - beware - not finished and not
	used anywhere in KIS, yet.

Tue Aug 24 23:23:25 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* integerwidget.h: 
	#undef Below and Above to fix compiler errors when calling
	IntegerWidget::setTickMarks( QSlider::Below ) (or Above )

	* integerwidget.cc,h:
	added class KSpinBox with the ability to set the focus directly to the
	QLineEedit of the spinbox. Call setEditFocus() to use this feature.
	
	Allows fast editing of values via keyboard. Photoshop gives focus to
	a lineedit when pressing Enter, so you can quickly use the numeric 
	keypad to change some value.

Wed Aug 18 10:30:18 1999  Matthias Elter  <me@kde.org>

	* KFD
	Fixed most of the remaining KFD problems.
	KFD focus handling and minimizing work now.
	KFD's are now recognized by the WM.
	Draw caption in KFD's title bar.
	
	* LayerView
	Changed the highlight color to gray as blue or anything else does not alwas
	fit to the KDE global titlebar colors.

	* BrushesDialog and LayerDialog
	added setCaption().

Wed Aug 18 01:05:01 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* kfloatingdialog.cc (paintEvent): 
	call QPainter::setClipping() and setClipRect() _after_ QPainter::begin()

	* iconchooser.cc:
	a few tiny cleanups

Tue Aug 17 01:10:54 1999  Carsten Pfeiffer  <pfeiffer@kde.org>

	* started ChangeLog :o)

	* kimageshop.idl:
	added slot viewBrushDialog()
	
	* kimageshop_view.cc,h:
	added menu entry for the brushdialog and modified everything to use
	the brusheswidget. Don't create brushes yourself, let the brusheswidget
	do that!
	
	* brushdialog.cc,h: 
	a floating tabdialog containing the BrushesWidget and more (TODO)
	
	* brusheswidget.cc,h: 
	the brushes chooser is the interface to all available brushes, it 
	loads them, offers a pointer to the current brush and emits a signal
 	when the brush is changed
	TODO: creating, editing, manual loading and saving of brushes

	* brush.cc,h:
	inherited from IconItem and added method pixmap() to make it usable
 	with the IconChooser
	const'ed a few methods

	* canvas.cc,h, kimageshop_view.cc,h, brushtool.cc,h:
	changed occurrences of Brush* to const Brush*

	* iconchooser.cc,h, iconitem.h:
	a generic iconchooser, used by the brusheswidget
	inherit from iconitem
	TODO: keyboard navigation
	TODO: the look of the items could be improved a bit

	* integerwidget.cc,h:
	this is just a convenience widget, as it will be used quite often, I
	think. Consists of a QSlider and a QSpinBox to allow setting some
	integer value
	TODO: The widgets are WAY too big though, need to paint them smaller
	TODO: Need a way to set focus to the QSpinBox LineEdit
