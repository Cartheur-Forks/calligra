	* started ChangeLog :o)

	* kimageshop.idl:
	added slot viewBrushDialog()
	
	* kimageshop_view.cc,h:
	added menu entry for the brushdialog and modified everything to use
	the brusheswidget. Don't create brushes yourself, let the brusheswidget
	do that!
	
	* brushdialog.cc,h: 
	a floating tabdialog containing the BrushesWidget and more (TODO)
	
	* brusheswidget.cc,h: 
	the brushes chooser is the interface to all available brushes, it 
	loads them, offers a pointer to the current brush and emits a signal
 	when the brush is changed
	TODO: creating, editing, manual loading and saving of brushes

	* brush.cc,h:
	inherited from IconItem and added method pixmap() to make it usable
 	with the IconChooser
	const'ed a few methods

	* canvas.cc,h, kimageshop_view.cc,h, brushtool.cc,h:
	changed occurrences of Brush* to const Brush*

	* iconchooser.cc,h, iconitem.h:
	a generic iconchooser, used by the brusheswidget
	inherit from iconitem
	TODO: keyboard navigation
	TODO: the look of the items could be improved a bit

	* integerwidget.cc,h:
	this is just a convenience widget, as it will be used quite often, I
	think. Consists of a QSlider and a QSpinBox to allow setting some
	integer value
	TODO: The widgets are WAY too big though, need to paint them smaller
	TODO: Need a way to set focus to the QSpinBox LineEdit
