o MIXER
+ Remove *all* std::vector
+ Check if I do coth and acoth correctly!
+ Do not redraw the whole canvas!
+ Find something about Gaussian quadrature
+ Implement KisIlluminantProfile using Gaussian quadrature upon 470 wavelenghs (use 15 wavelenghts)
- Implement KisReflectanceColorSpace (16 channels, 15 for colors + 1 for opacity)
+ Implement KisKSColorSpace (31 channels, 30 for colors (2 per wavelenght) + 1 for opacity)
- Implement configuration option widget for the mixer
- Implement loading/saving of configuration

o PAINT OPERATION
- Find something about the physical system involved.
- Look at some tutorials (Bart's one, probably...)
- Find a good way to implement bristles.
- Correct the Mixer so that it can handle such paintop.
- Probably more to come in these days.

o PHYSICS FILTER
- Find something about physical operation involved.
- Find a way to put this in the infrastructure of Krita
  - Can it be used with non-painterly color spaces?
  - Can it be used without painterly overlays?
- Find a good way to implement undo's.

o MORE TO COME
- Ask if I can add my color spaces to the color space registry.
- More reflectance curves and illuminant profiles.
- TEST TEST TEST!
