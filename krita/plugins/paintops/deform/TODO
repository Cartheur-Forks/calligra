TODO:
	-add KisRandomSubPixelAccessor for bilinear interpolatio
	-use some Rect Accessor for writing values (random accessor is slow, but needed for reading)
	-add support for oldRawData too (old version used that, now i use rawData)
	-add support to GUI to use/not use increment value from m_counter
	-any wish?
	-add support for tilt of the stylus to change CCW/CW
	-use kis_random_sub_accessor.cpp -- interpolations already in Krita
	- reconsider lens distortion coz of filter op and lens distorion plugin (works like magnifier glass when oldRawData used)
