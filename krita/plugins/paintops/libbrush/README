About libbrush 

libbrush is a library for handling brush resources. Brush resources
should not be confused with brush engines (or paintops). Brush engines
may or may not use a brush resource. Basically, brush resources provide
an image to make "footprints" with on the canvas, like with a potato
stamp. 

A brush's task is to basically return an image or a mask (depending on
the type) when the brush engine asks for it. The KisBrush class can
also keep a set of prescaled brush images or masks, which is handy
when using the pressure-size curve option for tablets.

There are several kinds of brush types:

 * gbr: Gimp one-image brushes, either a grayscale mask or a coloured image.
        There are also 16-bit .gbr brushes, created and used by CinePaint. 
        Krita is compatible with those, too.
 * gih: Gimp image hose brushes. Image hoses contain a set of images and
        some instructions to determine which image comes next
 * custom: this brush is generator from the image or a selection of the image
           and can be saved as an ordinary gbr or gih brush.
 * text: a basic brush created from some text and a font
 * auto: a brush defined from a shape and some parameters.

Other applications support other types of brushes:

 * png: krita used to use png images in stead of gbr brushes, and there
        are (march 2009) some noises that GIMP might want to use png
        brushes again.
 * svg: defining brushes in svg format has the advantage that scaling is
        lot nicer.
 * abr: photoshop's brush format. Early versions are open, later versions
        are closed
 * painter: Corel Painter has its own closed brush format that would be 
        interesting to support
 * myb: mypaint brushes. Open source and we really should try to support
        them, though it may only be useful for a special-built paintop.
