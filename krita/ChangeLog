	* Added Everaldo's wonderful icons.
01-01-2004
	* The brushes now cache their alpha mask; made a start
	(but it's going too slow) with adding hotspot, spacing
	and in-betweening to kis_tool_brush. When that's done,
	the brush is fine, and I'll start making a real fun 
	paint tool.

	* Added undo/redo to kis_tool_brush that seems to work
	* Changed kispainter to not use KMacroCommands to aggregate
   	  transactions.
	* Removed silly test tools.
xx-11-2003
	* Added a semi-working brush tool
14-10-2003
	* Added support for QTabletEvents to the tools
	* Added a silly test tool that puts red squares on the 
          page
        * Added a pen tool that uses QPainter
