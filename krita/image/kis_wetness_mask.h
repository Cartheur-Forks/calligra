/**
   A wetness mask simulates the wetness of pixels in the parent layer.
   In contrast with applications like Corel Painter, all layers can be
   wet. It depends on the material of the pixel which effect the
   wetness has. A layer with a wetness mask will dry at a particular
   rate through simulated air contact and adsorbency.

   XXX: think of a good way to visualize wetness. With real paint,
   wetness means deeper colors and reflections, but we obviously
   cannot reflect the user's face and hands in our paint.
