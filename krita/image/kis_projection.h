/**
   KisProjection is responsible for keeping the projection of the
   image's layer stack up to date. Krita's redisplay works as follows:

   * Any user action dirties a region (set of rects) on a layer.
   * The layer notifies the group layer it belongs to that it is dirty
   * This percolates up to the root layer
   * The root layer informs the projection that it has a new dirty
   region.
   * The projection aggregates the region with its dirty region.
   * The projection recomposition thread takes a rect from the dirty
   region.
   * The thread composites the rect
   * The thread emits a cross-thread signal that a certain rect has
   been recomposited
   * The canvas widget catches this signal and schedules an update
     which Qt aggregates into a paint event.


   XXX: Add a way to wait for recomposition for a particular rect to
        completed?

   XXX: Add regions-of-interest so kis_projection will only recomposit
        the interesting regions
