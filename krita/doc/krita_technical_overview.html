Krita 2.0 -- A Technical Overview

<p>This document describes the architecture of Krita for prospective developers
and plugin writers. It is intended to become part of our manual, just like the
plugin howto was part of the 1.x manual.</p>


<h1>Seagull's Overview</h1>

<p>Krita is a raster graphics application built on the Qt, KDE and KOffice
platform libraries. The design goals of Krita are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable the user to work with layered raster graphics of any sizei</li>
<li>Enable the user to create original art</li>
<li>Enable the user to work in any colorspace</li>
<li>Be flexible and extensible for developers</li>
<li>Be fun to hack on for developers</li>
</ul>

<p>Krita depends on two essential KOffice libraries:</>

<ul>
<li>Pigment (koffice/libs/pigment): handles colorspaces
<li>Flake (koffice/libs/flake): handles tools and user interaction and integrates 
fine-grained objects such as vector graphics or rich text in Krita.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most functionality in Krita is extensible through plugins:</p>

<ul>
<li>Colorspaces (through pigment): for example, grayscale, rgb, lms, cmyk, lab, xyz
<li>Content objects (through flake): for example: text, vector, charts
<li>Tools (krita/plugins/tools): for example: freehand filter, select-by-color, fill tool
<li>Brush engines (krita/plugins/paintops): for example: soft brush, chinese brush, smudge
<li>Filters (krita/plugins/filters): for example: sharpen, unsharp mask
<li>Generators (krita/plugins/generators): for example: fractal, solid color, pattern
<li>User interface additions (krita/plugins/viewplugins): for example: rescale, scripting
</ul>

<p>(Note that the painterly framework plugin (krita/plugins/painterlyframework) 
is a meta-plugin that contains plugins of many types. Also note that brush-type
plugins (as opposed to brush engine plugins) are a work-in-progress and part of
research into making resource types plugins.)</p>

<p>Krita itself consists of two libraries: the core functionality in krita/image
and the user interface in krita/ui.</p>
