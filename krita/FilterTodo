Alexander Prodoukine's comments about filters and some useful links:

1. Cropping. Most of my pictures go to web, which is why after
cropping I still have to make an additional step and resize them. It
would be great to be able to save and reuse cropping presets. For
example:

- Web landscape (800x533px, 72 dpi)
- Web portrait (533x800px, 72 dpi)

plus some presets for printing with larger Width and Height values and
300dpi. Using ratio spinbox isn't that comfortable - I do it since the
first release of GIMP 2.3.x with new cropping tool and I'm not very
fond of it.

Thus required changes would be:

- add dpi value to cropping tool;
- add ability to resize by cropping (BSAR: this is done by the transform tool);
- add presets mechanism.

Earlier I wrote about composition hints as guide lines while cropping.

2. Sharpening. Only simple non-adjustable sharpening tool is available
at the moment. It works for large images, but doesn't work for small
ones (images look oversharped), and one always needs applying some
sharpening after downscaling a photo.

It would be great having USM (Unsharp Mask) as adjustable layer.

Some useful info on unsharp masking:

3. Colorization. There is no colorization, neither as destructive
filter, nor as adjustment layer. This is a quite helpful filter when
you have lots of shots from a concert - because lighting on stage is
colored, pictures never look the way you see them and it's barely
fixable. Some people like it and some - difinitely not :)

4. Soft glow filter. Makes skin look softer, essential feature for
female portraits retouching :)
