/**
   A KisMaskShape is a flake shape wrapper around a KisMask. A KisMask
   is a single-channel (for now) 8-bit (for now) mask that belongs to
   a layer. Examples of masks are alpha masks (that hide part of a
   layer), filter masks (that filter part of a layer), selection masks
   (that determine which part of a layer is selected), painterly masks
   (that add some aspect of real-world media to the colors represented
   by a layer) or channel masks (that contain a single color channel
   extracted from the actual layer).
