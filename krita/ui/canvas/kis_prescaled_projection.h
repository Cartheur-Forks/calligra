 *
 * Optionally, the projection can also draw the mask and selection
 * masks and the selection outline.
 *
 * The following scaling methods are supported:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Qt's smooth scaling
 *   <li>Our own smooth scaling (similar to Blitz, port to using Blitz)
 *   <li>Our own sampling (similar to Blitz, port to using Blitz)
 *   <li>nearest-neighbour sampling on KisImage directly (doesn't need
 *       a QImage of the visible area)
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note: the export macro is only for the unittest.
 *
 * Note: with any method except for nearest-neighbour sampling Krita
 * keeps a QImage the size of the unscaled image in memory. This
 * should become either a QImage the size of the nearest pyramid level
 * or a tiled QImage representation like the OpenGL image textures.
