Selections

When you did a 'select all' and then create a selection nothing happens 
since you can't select more then you already did.  For that reason I 
suggest to make select all and deselect lead to a similar situation where 
adding a selection or substracting one will be smart and do make the 
result of that select or deselect visible.  In either case selecting a 
part in both a fully selected and fully deselected image should lead to 
the same result.

<BSAR: not going to do this: in the next release, it will be
always clear whether there's a selection because we're going to show it as a
child layer. For now, determining whether the extent of a selection is as big
as the extent of a layer, and whether the whole selection is completely 100%
selected is going to be too expensive>
