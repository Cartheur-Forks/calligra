Color palettes ;
You can drag a color from the preview swatches but it is changing the
selected one at click and since dropping drops on the selected one, the 
concept of duplicating the foreground to the background by dragging is 
impossible.  I suggest to do selecting of foreground/background color on 
mouse release instead.


When you did a 'select all' and then create a selection nothing happens 
since you can't select more then you already did.  For that reason I 
suggest to make select all and deselect lead to a similar situation where 
adding a selection or substracting one will be smart and do make the 
result of that select or deselect visible.  In either case selecting a 
part in both a fully selected and fully deselected image should lead to 
the same result.
