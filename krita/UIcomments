Zoom is in for form of n:m.  This is not really a commonly used format and
many people will have less problems interpreting a percentage format.  So 
200% or 50% instead of 2:1 or 1:2 (respectively).

Zoom tool;  it zooms by 2-complement changes. So 1, 2, 4, 8 etc.
This misses other well known nice looking zoom-levels. Like 33% Or, as 
krita displays it, 3-times zoom.
I suggest making the zoom use 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 etc.

Crop tool;
The crop tool should have statusbar details like position and size, which 
are continuesly updated.
The crop-options panel shows start and end coordinates. Please change that
to x/y and width/height ones. Additionally adding a 'keep aspect ratio' 
checkbox so users can type width=3D3 and height=3D2 to keep that aspect ratio 
from then on.

Color palettes ;
You can drag a color from the preview swatches but it is changing the
selected one at click and since dropping drops on the selected one, the 
concept of duplicating the foreground to the background by dragging is 
impossible.  I suggest to do selecting of foreground/background color on 
mouse release instead.

Color Range shows a dialog that also has extra margins around them, the 
groupbox on the right does not line up with the cancel right-side.
or the color range, I also fail to see what the dialog should do.
feature request; hide selection visualization (but leave the selection in
place). Similar feature in Photoshop can be found under 'Ctrl-H'.
When you did a 'select all' and then create a selection nothing happens 
since you can't select more then you already did.  For that reason I 
suggest to make select all and deselect lead to a similar situation where 
adding a selection or substracting one will be smart and do make the 
result of that select or deselect visible.  In either case selecting a 
part in both a fully selected and fully deselected image should lead to 
the same result.
