Statusbar;
The coordinates of the pointer is not correctly clipped to the document;=20
when I move my cursor to the menu bar I often have negative coordinates.
When I move my cursor to the far right, outside of the image, I also see=20
it continue to count. I find that confusing.

Zoom is in for form of n:m.  This is not really a commonly used format and=
=20
many people will have less problems interpreting a percentage format.  So=20
200% or 50% instead of 2:1 or 1:2 (respectively).

The 'selection' part shows 'Selection Active' or 'No selection'.
Apart from the missing capital S, I think we can put a little more=20
information in there.  What about printing the selection size in pixels?

The ruler keeps counting across the full size of the window, it should=20
make a difference between image content and outside. I suggest to make it=20
stop at the image edge. If you don't want that, you might want to make=20
the ruler be white inside the image and gray outside.

Zoom tool;  it zooms by 2-complement changes. So 1, 2, 4, 8 etc.
This misses other well known nice looking zoom-levels. Like 33% Or, as=20
krita displays it, 3-times zoom.
I suggest making the zoom use 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 etc.
Also; please unzoom the image to fit on screen at initial loading.

Crop tool;
The crop tool should have statusbar details like position and size, which=20
are continuesly updated.
The crop-options panel shows start and end coordinates. Please change that=
=20
to x/y and width/height ones. Additionally adding a 'keep aspect ratio'=20
checkbox so users can type width=3D3 and height=3D2 to keep that aspect rat=
io=20
from then on.

Overview palette:
The zoom slider can zoom to 1600%, which makes the slider really hard to=20
navigate around the < 100 % zoom area. I suggest either making the slider=20
logoritmic or changing the maximum.
Also; add a '%' suffix to the spinbox.
Last; why is the space between the 'Zoom:' label and its slider soo much=20
larger then the space betweenthe 'Exposure:' label and that slider ?

Color palettes ;
pressing the 'reset colors' icon directly under the foreground/background=20
preview swatches does not change the background to white, as I would=20
expect.
You can drag a color from the preview swatches but it is changing the=20
selected one at click and since dropping drops on the selected one, the=20
concept of duplicating the foreground to the background by dragging is=20
impossible.  I suggest to do selecting of foreground/background color on=20
mouse release instead.
=46or all the 'tracks' in the RGB and Gray palettes you can change the=20
current position of the slider by clicking, but you can't keep updating=20
it by dragging.  Please copy the behavior of any slider and continuesly=20
update the value on click until the mouse is released again.  See QSlider=20
behavior for how to handle mouse-drag events outside the widget=20
boundaries.
The HSV/RGB/Gray have labels in front of the color-sliders. Please follow=20
the styleguide and let all such labels end with a colon ":"

The Pan tool:
This tool (and various others I'm not going to iterate) has no options. =20
The tool-palette ends up empty, including the tab-name.  I expected the=20
tab-name to be filled and a label 'This tool has no options' to be shown=20
there.

Color Picker tool:
The 'Normalize integer values' should not be enabled by default.  I would=20
also like to suggest it converts the values to percentages instead of=20
values between 0 and 1.
The label could then be renamed to something much less technical like=20
'Colors in percentages'
The 'update current color' checkbox indeed updates the color (painting=20
something works just fine) but the HSV/RGB/etc palettes are not altered,=20
I expected them to be updated continuesly.

Autobrush selector (the one that pops up in its own window)
The toolbar button preview seems to set the maximum size for the button=20
shown on the autobrush tab. As the button is much larger then the maximum=20
size of the preview painted on it, I would suggest the preview be allowed=20
to get bigger. Almost as big as the button.width() itself.
Using [tab] there seems to be no way to traverse focus between the=20
different widgets on the panel (like the spinboxes). is that a bug that=20
can be fixed?

Shear image tool:
Window has double margins around it, the outline of the groupbox don't=20
match up with the button on the right.
Please add degrees suffixes in the spinboxes

Layer menu;
Please look at the naming and icons of KWords equivalent of the=20
'lower/raise' features (all 4 of them) I think that with just minor=20
changes they can be shared between kword/kpresenter and krita.
Add a 'disk' icon in front of the 'save layer as image'
Layer properties dialog has a margin too many at the outside; the right=20
does not line up with the cancel buttons right side.
Histogram menu item should not have trailing ellipses (...) at the end=20
since the action to show this is actually done immediately.

Select:
reselect is enabled when I startup krita with a loaded jpeg; I never=20
selected anything yet. Looks like a bug.
=46eather has '...' at the end suggesting there is going to be a dialog, bu=
t=20
there is none.  So either remove the ellipses, or provide a feather=20
distance (I prefer the latter ;)
Color Range shows a dialog that also has extra margins around them, the=20
groupbox on the right does not line up with the cancel right-side.
=46or the color range, I also fail to see what the dialog should do.
=46eature request; hide selection visualization (but leave the selection in=
=20
place). Similar feature in Photoshop can be found under 'Ctrl-H'.
When you did a 'select all' and then create a selection nothing happens=20
since you can't select more then you already did.  For that reason I=20
suggest to make select all and deselect lead to a similar situation where=20
adding a selection or substracting one will be smart and do make the=20
result of that select or deselect visible.  In either case selecting a=20
part in both a fully selected and fully deselected image should lead to=20
the same result.


Misc:
* Please make a circular brush be the default selected one.
* Statusbar height is weird; on autosave the statusbar gets smaller and I=20
find the normal size to be pretty tall for no good reason.
