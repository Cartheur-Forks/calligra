Color palettes ;

You can drag a color from the preview swatches but it is changing the
selected one at click and since dropping drops on the selected one, the 
concept of duplicating the foreground to the background by dragging is 
impossible.  I suggest to do selecting of foreground/background color on 
mouse release instead.

<BSAR: I don't understand this at all -- not sure what you're talking about.>

Selections

When you did a 'select all' and then create a selection nothing happens 
since you can't select more then you already did.  For that reason I 
suggest to make select all and deselect lead to a similar situation where 
adding a selection or substracting one will be smart and do make the 
result of that select or deselect visible.  In either case selecting a 
part in both a fully selected and fully deselected image should lead to 
the same result.

<BSAR: not going to do this: in the next release, it will be
always clear whether there's a selection because we're going to show it as a
child layer. For now, determining whether the extent of a selection is as big
as the extent of a layer, and whether the whole selection is completely 100%
selected is going to be too expensive>

Opacity and Layers

In the layer palette there is a custom widget that allows you to set the
transparancy of the layer. It has a popup (with slider) as well as a text-area.

The text area has the annoying behavior that it will verify AND CHANGE your
entry while you type.

The effect is that the transparancy is set to 1 and your cursor is positioned
after the '%' sign.

Try again by placing your cursor after the '0'.  I note that the place-after
concept is impossible in this widget as the 0 is selected, no matter what I do

I can't get an insert cursor here. (bug 2)

I type a 0 and simply overwrite the former.
Between each change there is a huge delay as my image is repainting and due
to the cursor being moved to a unpredictable location I am stuck waiting and
retrying.

I suggest to use a normal spinbox with validator and (very very important) not
use overwrite mode!

Last; please merge all undo-commands into one (i.e. update the last) until this
widget has seen a focus-lost!

The slider (of the transparany part in the layer-palette) should have a step of
'10' and we should consider copying the photoshop behavior where clicking
anywhere in the gutter will move the slider directly there (which Qt does on
middle-mouse click).
