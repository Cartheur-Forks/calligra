* Fix speed of painting.
* Move composite ops and paint ops to capability framework
* Add tranform dialog (scale, shear etc.) and debug transform code.
* Fix drawing position to be middle of each brush, instead of under the brush -- see linetool
* Fix linetool to use pressure to draw tapered lines.
* The custom cursor show up in a white block if not run using a graphics card with hardware cursors.
* The tabs for images inside a document seem to be broken :-( -- use Aditya's new common tabbar when it's done
* Brush cursor shapes for tools (updating cursors from the tools doesn't work yet).
* Give each layer its own imagetype; allow layers of diverse types in one image.
* Option dialog for tools
* Make tools kparts
* Fix scrollbars
* make brush tool antialiased; make un-antialiased pen tool
* If you have a tablet, you can have more than one active tool at a time:
	stylus, eraser, pointer and your ordinary mouse, not to mention
	the possibility of having several styluses.
* Implement saving/loading of tool properties.
* redo configuration dialog
* Find a way to set the hourglass cursor when doing complex things from
	e.g. KisPainter.
* Make pipe brushes pay attention to the instructions in the 'parasite'
* Use patterns and gradients while painting

User interface

        * add tool palette
        * add tool option palette
        * make the sidebar elements dockable, floatable palettes
        * show/hide rulers
        * add decent toolbar icons
        * config dialog
        * gradient dialog
        * the progressbar in the statusbar gets mad sometimes, 
          appearing twice

Tools

        * pen, pencil, airbrush, chalk etc.
        * text tool
        * more types of selection
        * smear, convolve etc.
        * rotate, scale, shear

Core

        * Add support for natural media-like painting
        * Add support for filters
        * There's something broken about channels, I guess

To investigate

        * plugins -- what are they, how should they work,
          what's the interface to Krita
        * graphics algorithms. One cannot steal from the Gimp
          forever


Old TODO, parts of it seem pretty obsolete, and others are more of a 'redo'
than a 'todo':

- color modes: Indexed, Greyscale, RGB and RGBA, CMYK, CMKYA
- channels (RGB, CMYK, HSB, etc...)
- layer masks
- plugin filter API
- plugin tool API
- basic image manipulation (contrast/brightness/saturation etc.)
- scale images
- basic plugin filters (blur/sharpen etc.)
- basic image transformations (rotate, mirror)
- move tool
- crop tool
- basic text tool
- color picker tool
- fill tool (fill with color or pattern)
- gradient tool
- pen (paint brush or pattern)
- airbrush (paint brush or pattern)
- eraser
- blur/sharpen with brush tool 
- fullscreen editing mode
- Rotate layouts
- Saves channel information to file
- Undo/Redo
- preview in pixel
- Canvas size should be independent of image size
- Rulers use kivio rulers
