User interface

        * add tool palette
        * add tool option palette
        * make the sidebar elements dockable, floatable palettes
        * show/hide rulers
        * add decent toolbar icons
        * config dialog
        * gradient dialog
        * the progressbar in the statusbar gets mad sometimes, 
          appearing twice

Tools

        * brush, pen, pencil, airbrush, chalk etc.
        * text tool
        * more types of selection
        * smear, convolve etc.
        * rotate, scale, shear

Core

        * Add support for natural media-like painting
        * Add support for filters
        * There's something broken about channels, I guess

To investigate

        * plugins -- what are they, how should they work,
          what's the interface to Krita
        * graphics algorithms. One cannot steal from the Gimp
          forever
