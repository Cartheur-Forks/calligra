Regressions from 1.x
=======================================================================

* Image



* UI

    * Bird's eyeview docker: Hubipete started a KOffice-wide one, check status
      and make sure it's extensible with our own widgets (for exposure)
    * The filter listview is broken, breaking the adjustment layers dialog
    * Progress reporting
    * Order in the toolbox has changed
    * Split view crashes
    * opening a backup file causes a crash ( krita(8568)/koffice (filter manager) 
      KoFilterManager::importDocument: Can't open  "application/zip" , trying filter chooser
      ASSERT: "mime" in file /home/boud/kde/src/koffice/libs/main/KoFilterManager.cpp, line 82)
    * Zoom fit to page/canvas doesn't work after cropping an image Opening a backup file crashes
    * Tablet settings page is back at softer/firmer, which doesn't work: Qt4 does not allow
      us to do much with tablet settings
    * Rulers are uglier and have tab settings, which isn't relevant for Krita's layer shapes

* Tools

    * Magnetic Outline Tool has not been ported yet
    * Curve Paint and Curve Select tool are not ported yet:
      They should be implemented using flake (there's only the vector
      selection tools right now, but they are not freehand/curve, while
      the curve paint tool is )
    * Perspective Transform Tool has not been ported yet

* Filters 

    (Check also http://wiki.koffice.org/index.php?title=Krita/Filters_State)

    * Port bummap filter (needs access to image for layers)
    * CImg filter
    
* Paintops

    * Smudge op

* View Plugins

    * Histogram Docker needs to be reimplemented
    * Select all Opaque Pixels
    * Drop shadow crashes Krita in the tile manager

* Brushes

    * Initial brush is wrong (often an arrow, instead of a 5px dynamic brush)
    * Sometimes, not all brushes are loaded

* Colorspaces

    * LMS (is now dependent on OpenCTl)
    * Wet (may be deprecated definitively given EmanueleT's color work)


2.0
=======================================================================

* Bugs

    * The filter dialog asks for a Ruby interpreter?
    * Filters that need access to the whole image do not work correctly with masks.

    * Edit grid tool is not keyed to the right shapes yet
    * Edit perspective grid tool is not keyed to the right shapes yet
    * Krita needs to get its own toolbox, separately from the the KOffice toolbox
    * The KOffice toolbox may need to become an ordinary toolbar: propose to KOffice ML.
