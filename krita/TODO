Krayon is the KOffice image manipulation application.
It does not aim to be a direct competitor to the GIMP,
but to integrate well with the other KOffice applications,
to be easy to use and yet powerfull.

We are curently in a beta developement stage but
work towards a 1.0 release that comes with all basic
image manipulation features.

The following feature list aims to give us an idea of what
we want to have in the 1.0 release:

- color modes: Indexed, Greyscale, RGB and RGBA.
- layers/channels
- layer masks
- plugin filter API
- plugin tool API
- basic image manipulation (contrast/brightness/saturation etc.)
- scale images
- zooming
- native XML file format
- basic import/export filters (png/jpg/tif/gif)
- basic plugin filters (blur/sharpen etc.)
- basic image transformations (rotate, mirror)
- move tool
- crop tool
- basic text tool
- color picker tool
- fill tool (fill with color or pattern)
- gradient tool
- pen (paint brush or pattern)
- brush (paint brush or pattern)
- airbrush (paint brush or pattern)
- eraser
- blur/sharpen with brush tool 
- fullscreen editing mode
- Rules a la gimp 
- Rotate layouts
- Saves channel information to file
- Undo/Redo

BUGS

- Selection tools don't get redrawed when they need to (except for rectangle select now)
- opacity is totally broken, it sort of almost works for a white background, but nothing else
- Paint offset causes mispaint
- Save in tool propeties does not work
- New for modified document does not give error
