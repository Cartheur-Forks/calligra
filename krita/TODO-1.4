Krita buglist for KOffice release 1.4

* File/Import and File/Export show some Unknown filetypes and don't
  warn when exporting to an unsupported filetype.

* Removing current image does not ask whether to save the image
  even if it has been changed -> people will expect Krita to save the
  image in its import format. Nobody will assume that all the tabs
  together form one big document that is saved/exported as a whole.

* What's the difference between gamma correction and colour adjustment?

* The Variations plugin is just a mockup and does not use the same
  preview as the rest of Krita.

* Link/unlink layer sets a nice icon. but doesn't actually link the
  layer to anything.

* Merge layer doesn't do anything

* Layer size doesn't do resize, just scaled. The dialog is ugly
  when the resize/scale option widget is hidden. The layer is scaled
  correctly, but when scaled down, the old tiles are not removed.

* There are no example script files for use with the scripting enging

* There is no Krita handbook yet.

Selections

* Select freehand (drawing a shape and selecting the contents) does not work. Should be disabled.

* The shape tools should (with filled as default) also be available as 
  selection tools. (fixed for ellipse)

* Cropping should also crop the selection.

* Select Polygonal does not work. Should be fixed or disabled

* Select wizard appears broken again

* Copy does not work for some selections

* problems when working with inverted selections. The selection is infinite which not everyone handles gracefully.

Gradients


Painting

* The shapes tools should offer a filled shape option

* The convolution paintop doesn't do anything at all.

* Long painter operations (e.g., convolution painter) should use the 
  progressbar and be cancelable.

* Add easy convolution painter tool: smear, blur and sharpen.

Color models


Filters


Import/Export

* The image magick build should be ported to the fileformat framework
  and put in its own plugin (KisFileFormat, KisFileFormatRegistry)

* The image magick plugin should use KisAnnotation to preserve image
  data on roundtrips.

Widgets


Layers

* implement layer locking.

Transform/rotate

* The transform tool does not produce reproducable resutls
* Rotating an image leaves transparant borders around the image. 
* Rotating 90/180/270 degrees is broken.


Printing

* Only one image is currently printed (but that's actually a feature)
* No CMYK separation for printing
* No use of the resolution parameter (but the resolution dialog is still only a .ui file and not implemented at all)

Integration

* A krita document embedded in KWord has the wrong scaling
* On embedding a krita document in KWord, the user is asked for a document using the
  template dialog. On selecting a .png, the user is told that png images cannot be
  imported.
* There is currently no kimgio module for Krita images.
