Krita buglist for KOffice release 1.4

* File/Import and File/Export don't warn when exporting to
  an unsupported filetype. (check if this is still valid)

* What's the difference between gamma correction and colour
  adjustment? -> explained by Cyrille's mail, put this in handbook. We need
  a fix, too. See mailing list.

* Krita crashes sometimes involving undo/redo and then some painting. 
  Suspects that either undo or redo doesn't set hashtable correctly.


Selections

* The shape tools should (with filled as default) also be available as 
  selection tools. (fixed for ellipse)

* Cropping, mirroring, scaling should also transform the selection -
  or take it into account

* Select Polygonal does not work. Should be fixed or disabled

* Implement action and invert when subtract for ellipse and brush
  selection tools


Gradients


Painting

* The shapes tools should offer a filled shape option

* The convolution paintop doesn't do anything at all.

* Add easy convolution painter tool: smear, blur and sharpen.

Color models


Filters

Transform/rotate

* The transform tool does not produce reproducable resutls

Integration

* A krita document embedded in KWord has the wrong scaling

* Why three Krita file formats in the file dialog when we support only one?
