Krita buglist for KOffice release 1.4

* File/Import and File/Export show some Unknown filetypes and don't
  warn when exporting to an unsupported filetype.

* The radio actions for showing/hiding dockers don't work.

* Removing current image does not ask whether to save the image
  even if it has been changed -> people will expect Krita to save the
  image in its import format. Nobody will assume that all the tabs
  together form one big document that is saved/exported as a whole.

* What's the difference between gamma correction and colour adjustment?

* The Variations plugin is just a mockup and does not use the same
  preview as the rest of Krita.

* Link/unlink layer sets a nice icon. but doesn't actually link the
  layer to anything.

* Convert layer type doesn't do anything

* Merge layer doesn't do anything

 Merge visible layers is only accessable if there are non-visible
  layers. It should always be accessible even if there are only
  visible layers.

* Histogram doesn't do anything yet.

* Layer size doesn't do resize, just scaled. The dialog is ugly
  when the resize/scale option widget is hidden. The layer is scaled
  correctly, but when scaled down, the old tiles are not removed.

* Select invert doesn't correctly update the image outside the
  selection rect

* None of the selection menu options do anything yet, the
  select-by-color dialog shows just the dialog.

* There are no example script files for use with the scripting enging

* The settings dialog has no icons yet

* The cursor settings only take effect _after_ a tool change

* The description field in color settings is empty.   

* There is no Krita handbook yet.

* Convert image doesn't work (commented out with autolayer merge)

Selections

* selection management is broken: sometimes the gui doesn't realize
  we've got a selection, and sometimes it forgets it has disappeared.
  This ties in with Casper's work on making selection undo/redo
  history work.

* On change to a layer without a selection, do not show selection.

* Select freehand (drawing a shape and selecting the contents) does not work

* Other selection menu options are not implemented either, except for 
  invert.

* The shape tools should (with filled as default) also be available as 
  selection tools.

* All select tools should be undoable/redoable.

* The selected parameter in KisPixel should be filled or removed.
  
Gradients


Painting

* The shapes tools should offer a filled shape option

* The ConvolutionPainter does not take isSelected() into account.

* The convolution paintop doesn't do anything at all.

* Long painter operations (e.g., convolution painter) should use the 
  progressbar and be cancelable.

* Add easy convolution painter tool: smear, blur and sharpen.

Color models

* Combining layers with different color models in one image crashes
  Krita -> see stacktraces.

* The shape tools should have a fill option (e.g., use wdgshapeoptions)

Flatten

* Flattening an image with two layers creates a new layer named "layer
  3", while people will expect to have the resulting layer have the
  same name as their bottom layer.


Filters

Import/Export

* The image magick build should be ported to the fileformat framework
  and put in its own plugin (KisFileFormat, KisFileFormatRegistry)

* The image magick plugin should use KisAnnotation to preserve image
  data on roundtrips.

* Open file does not show all the file formats that are shown in import
  (for instance, no .psd)

Widgets

* All opacity spinboxes must have the % suffix.

Layers

*y implement layer locking. Fix the lock icon.

Transform/rotate

* The transform tool does not produce reproducable resutls
* Rotating an image leaves transparant borders around the image. 

Files

* Image/Export should show all posssible file formats
* Import/Export should be in the file menu.
