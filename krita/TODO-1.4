Krita buglist for KOffice release 1.4

* File/Import and File/Export don't warn when exporting to
  an unsupported filetype. (Still valid).

* What's the difference between gamma correction and colour
  adjustment? -> explained by Cyrille's mail, put this in handbook. We need
  a fix, too. See mailing list.

* Photoshop files are not recognized when opened, but there is now an
  option in the list of filetypes and that works.

Selections

* The shape tools should (with filled as default) also be available as 
  selection tools. (fixed for ellipse) (We may have to remove the
  poly selection tool if it isn't fixed before Monday, see also
  painting todo).
 
* Mirroring, scaling should also transform the selection -
  or take it into account. 

  Current problems: 
	* on rotating with a selection present, all non-selected bits
	  are cleared. The selection is not rotated.
	* On mirroring, the whole image is mirrored, not the selected
	  bits. The selection is not mirrored.
	* Shear ditto.

* If there is a selection present, on activating the crop tool, the
  initial crop rectangle should be sized to the exact bounds of the
  selection.  

* Select Polygonal does not work. Should be fixed or disabled

* Select colorrange dialog appears to be broken -- the dialog has no
  "replace" option anymore, which is necessary, and the preview only
  takes effect after the selection has been made. Selecting by tone
  gives a very curious effect.

* I still cannnot decipher the selection icons; they need to be
  replaced with similar icons with the original tool icon on the
  selection border field.

Painting

* The shapes tools should offer a filled shape option (Adrian is
  working on this now).
	
* The convolution paintop doesn't do anything at all. (But it isn't
  used anywhere yet, so that's not so bad, perhaps. We cannot add a
  new tool at the moment anyway. Let's scrap this todo item.)

* Add easy convolution painter tool: smear, blur and sharpen. -> This
  must be done with the filter painter tool. (Boudewijn is going to
  pick this up.)


* It is not obvious how the duplicate tool works, and consequently
  hard to determine wether it works correctly.

Color spaces

* Conversion from RGB to GRAY works, but vice versa not.

Transform/rotate

* The transform tool does not produce reproducable resutls.

Integration

* A krita document embedded in KWord has the wrong scaling

* Why three Krita file formats in the file dialog when we support only one?

Filters

* Why cannot I get autocontrast to do something useful? Is it my sample images,
  or is autocontrast not working correctly?

Plugins

* The snapshot plugin now overwrites the image instead of adding a new image
  to the document: it should create a new view with the snapshot.
