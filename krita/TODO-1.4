Krita buglist for KOffice release 1.4

* File/Import and File/Export don't warn when exporting to
  an unsupported filetype. (Still valid).

* Photoshop files are not recognized when opened, but there is now an
  option in the list of filetypes and that works.

* Why three different Krita file types.

Selections

* Mirroring, scaling should also transform the selection -
  or take it into account. 

  Current problems: 
	* On mirroring, the whole image is mirrored, not the selected
	  bits. The selection is not mirrored.
	* Shear ditto.

* Select colorrange dialog appears to be broken -- the dialog has no
  "replace" option anymore, which is necessary, and the preview only
  takes effect after the selection has been made. Selecting by tone
  gives a very curious effect.

* I still cannnot decipher the selection icons; they need to be
  replaced with similar icons with the original tool icon on the
  selection border field.

Painting

* The convolution paintop doesn't do anything at all. (But it isn't
  used anywhere yet, so that's not so bad, perhaps. We cannot add a
  new tool at the moment anyway. Let's scrap this todo item.)

* Add easy convolution painter tool: smear, blur and sharpen. -> This
  must be done with the filter painter tool. (Boudewijn is going to
  pick this up.)

* It is not obvious how the duplicate tool works, and consequently
  hard to determine wether it works correctly.

Transform tool

* Use filter during scaling

Integration

* A krita document embedded in KWord has the wrong scaling

* Why three Krita file formats in the file dialog when we support only one?

Filters

* Why cannot I get autocontrast to do something useful? Is it my sample images,
  or is autocontrast not working correctly?
