Krita buglist for KOffice release 1.4

* File/Import and File/Export don't warn when exporting to
  an unsupported filetype. (Still valid).

* Photoshop files are not recognized when opened, but there is now an
  option in the list of filetypes and that works.

Selections

* Mirroring, scaling should also transform the selection -
  or take it into account. 

  Current problems: 
	* On mirroring, the whole image is mirrored, not the selected
	  bits. The selection is not mirrored.
	* Shear ditto.

* Select colorrange dialog appears to be broken -- the dialog has no
  "replace" option anymore, which is necessary, and the preview only
  takes effect after the selection has been made. Selecting by tone
  gives a very curious effect.

Transform tool

* It should use filter during scaling

* It doesn't handle "infinite" selections

Integration

* A krita document embedded in KWord has the wrong scaling

Filters

* Why cannot I get autocontrast to do something useful? Is it my sample images,
  or is autocontrast not working correctly?
