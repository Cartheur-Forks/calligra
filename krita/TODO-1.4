Krita buglist for KOffice release 1.4

* File/Import and File/Export don't warn when exporting to
  an unsupported filetype. (check if this is still valid)

* What's the difference between gamma correction and colour adjustment?

* The layer is scaled correctly, but when scaled down, the old tiles are not removed.

* There are no example script files for use with the scripting engine

Selections

* Select freehand (drawing a shape and selecting the contents) does not work. Should be disabled.

* The shape tools should (with filled as default) also be available as 
  selection tools. (fixed for ellipse)

* Cropping, mirroring, scaling should also transform the selection - or take it into account

* Select Polygonal does not work. Should be fixed or disabled

* Select wizard appears broken again

* Copy does not work for some selections

* Think of something with action: Either implement or disable


Gradients


Painting

* The shapes tools should offer a filled shape option

* The convolution paintop doesn't do anything at all.

* Long painter operations (e.g., convolution painter) should use the 
  progressbar and be cancelable.

* Add easy convolution painter tool: smear, blur and sharpen.

Color models


Filters


Import/Export

* The image magick build should be ported to the fileformat framework
  and put in its own plugin (KisFileFormat, KisFileFormatRegistry)

* The image magick plugin should use KisAnnotation to preserve image
  data on roundtrips. (BC: This is done now for EXIF and ICC Profiles, but
  what about PNG comment chunks, gamma information and so? That still gets lost afaik)

* Now that we can actually save EXIF/ICC data to jpegs and pngs, it might be a good idea
  to save them to the native krita format as well. (ICC data gets saved by name,
  but that doesn't work with profiles from an imported file)


Transform/rotate

* The transform tool does not produce reproducable resutls


Printing

* Only one image is currently printed (but that's actually a feature)
* No CMYK separation for printing
* No use of the resolution parameter (but the resolution dialog is still only a .ui file and not implemented at all)


Integration

* A krita document embedded in KWord has the wrong scaling
* On embedding a krita document in KWord, the user is asked for a document using the
  template dialog. On selecting a .png, the user is told that png images cannot be
  imported.
* There is currently no kimgio module for Krita images.
