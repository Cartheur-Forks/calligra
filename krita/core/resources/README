krita/core/resources

Code for loading of Gimp resources:

brushes
patterns
gradients
...

Todo:

- Make standalone library for use in other KDE
applications than Krita.
- Load parasites and interpret
- Add saving of gimp resources when we've got
code to create resources in the first place.
- Loading/saving of palettes.
- Get rid of dependency on ui package
