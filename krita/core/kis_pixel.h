/**
 * KisPixel and KisPixelRO are the primary classes to access individual pixel data.
 * A pixel consists of channels of a certain size. At the moment, all channels must
 * be of the same size, and that size is one byte, or QUANTUM. In the future
 * pixels with heteregenous channels and larger (or smaller?) channels will be
 * possible, too.
 *
 * The [] operator returns the channel at that index. You can discover the number
 * of channels and the names of the channels by querying the color strategy.
 * All channels can be accessed using this method.
 *
 * There are three types of channels: color, alpha and substance.
 *
 * Generally, in filters and suchlike code, you can treat all color channels the same, 
 * and have a different algorithm for alpha. Substance is a future extension, usable
 * for wetness, grainyness or thickness.
 *
 * The color channels come first -- this is useful if you want to loop over 
 * these channels (for int i = 0; i < colorspace -> nColorChannels(); ++i) { hack(pixel[i]); }.
 *
 * The next index after the colour channels points to the alpha channel. A pointer to
 * the value of the alpha channel can also be retrieved with alpha(). Always
 * check whether there is actually an alpha channel, otherwise alpha() will
 * return the first channel of the next pixel, most probably, or perhaps even
 * something worse.
 * 
 * After alpha, the substance channels will come.
 *
 * Note: once you start working with color management a sequence of bytes that happens to
 * encode R, G and B values is still meaningless. You cannot know what _color_ the bytes
 * represent unless you also have a profile. So KisPixel must know about the profile, too.
