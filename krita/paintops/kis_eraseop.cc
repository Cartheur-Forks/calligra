//
// That's what this paint op does for now; however, anyone who has
// ever worked with paper and soft pencils knows that a sharp piece of
// eraser rubber is a pretty useful too for making sharp to fuzzy lines
// in the graphite layer, or equally useful: for smudging skin tones.
//
// A smudge tool for Krita is in the making, but when working with
// a tablet, the eraser tip should be at least as functional as a rubber eraser.
// That means that only after repeated or forceful application should all the
// 'paint' or 'graphite' be removed from the surface -- a kind of pressure
// sensitive, incremental smudge.
//
// And there should be an option to not have the eraser work on certain
// kinds of material. Layers are just a hack for this; putting your ink work
// in one layer and your pencil in another is not the same as really working
// with the combination.
