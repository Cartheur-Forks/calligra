Bugs

B  119401   ASSI      Action 'change image size' crops source image

Current user interface issues (see also UIComments):

* star tool: Ratio should be drop down spinbox
* color picker: top combo should be as wide as the whole widget; the widget is a bit too big,
  we should try to make the listview a lot smaller. Maybe just use labels here?
* brush, gradient, pattern buttons: should always be _square_
* Add Palette dialog should have Cancel button (the layout also looks wierd, don't know why)
* The edit palette dialog two-step should be changed into a single dialog
* Maybe we should put the filter config widget on the right-hand side of the preview, like
  Digikam does?
* Custom convolution filter widget layout is iffy
* Simple noise reducer action should have ...
* Wavelet noise reducer action should have ...
* Scripting docker is far too wide when using the platinum widget style
* When splitting the view, and adding or removing layers, only one view is updated

Also: see UIcomments!

Crashes

* When removing a layer when the image is split, a crash in the palette code
