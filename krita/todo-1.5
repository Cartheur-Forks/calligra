Filters

C  * Fix crashes in filters

Colorspaces

B  * Implement the last few colorspace dependencies in KisAbstractColorSpace
?  * Optimize colorspace functions at least in 8 and 16 bit rgb where possible

Core

R  * disable everything necessary when the current layer is wet.
C  * finish the convolution painter
R  * Fix adj. layers issues Gary reported

User interface

P  * Try to optimize histogram docker
R  * Finish separation plugin to separate to different images
A  * Fix display glitches when resizing image or view
R  * Check all tool option widgets for layout errors
?  * Lock all actions when layers are locked or invisible, not just filters
and tools (#90456)

Files and Import/Export

C  * add support for YCbCr in TIFF and fix the reading of deflate files

Tools

B  * Fix transform tool
?  * Disable tools that don't work with group layers when the current layer is
     a group layer.

Plugins

C  * finish, polish and document scripting support
R  * document plugin API

Release

R  * develop thorough test plan and exercise it on several installations
     before release
