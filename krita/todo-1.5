There are still a couple of LAYERREMOVE's around!

?  * Shear
?  * shearLayer

Filters

C  * Fix crashes in filters

Colorspaces

B  * Implement the last few colorspace dependencies in KisAbstractColorSpace
?  * Optimize colorspace functions at least in 8 and 16 bit rgb where possible
R  * Fix drying the wet colorspace
?  * cmyk select similar colors doesn't work

Core

A  * When painting with the qpainter, if the zoom factor is < 1, we should first
     scale down, then colorcorrect, then add the masks, then paint. This would
     solve the slow loading for big images problem.
P  * Fix part layers (nearly done)
R  * disable everything necessary when the current layer is wet.
C  * finish the convolution painter
R  * rendering with complex groupings gives very wrong results

User interface

P  * Try to optimize histogram docker
R  * Finish separation plugin to separate to different images
A  * Fix display glitches when resizing image or view

Files and Import/Export

C  * add support for YCbCr in TIFF and fix the reading of deflate files

Tools

B  * Fix transform tool
?  * Disable tools that don't work with group layers when the current layer is
     a group layer.

Plugins

C  * finish, polish and document scripting support
R  * document plugin API

Release

R  * develop thorough test plan and exercise it on several installations
     before release

Bugs

B  119401   ASSI      Action 'change image size' crops source image

Current user interface issues:

* Canvas & dockers change position every time a different tool is selected.
* Line, polygon, polyline tool, duplicate: ? button is too big
* Rectangle, ellipse, polygon, polyline, star tool: not the same spacing between labels and elements
* star tool: the vertices/ration spinners are spaced near the bottom. Ratio should be
  drop down spinbox
* transform: too much space around block of options (crop is okay, check how to fix there)
* text tool: everything is too narrow, too much bunched up to the left. font ... button is too big
* color picker: top combo should be as wide as the whole widget; the widget is a bit too big.,
  we should try to make the listview a lot smaller. Maybe just use labels here?
* contiguous area: options are near bottom of widget
* select similar: options are near bottom of widget
* brush, gradient, pattern buttons: should always be _square_
* Add Palette dialog should have Cancel button (the layout also looks wierd, don't know why)
* The edit palette dialog two-step should be changed into a single dialog
* When splitting and unsplitting (or selecting/unselecting a part layer) all palettes
  except the one with the tool options in it disappear.
* Layer properties dialog: the opacity dropdown is too small (perhaps because
  it's hard-coded for a smaller font?
* Select/transform... no dialog appears
* Brightness-contrast should have some help text under the curve widget (but it's maybe too late
  for that now.)
* Cubism is disabled for cmyk: it should be enabled, but give a warning
* Maybe we should put the filter config widget on the right-hand side of the preview, like
  Digikam does?
* Filters should be re-ordered in less categories
* Custom convolution filter widget layout is iffy
* Simple noise reducer action should have ...
* Wavelet noise reducer action should have ...
* Scripting docker is far too wide when using the platinum widget style
