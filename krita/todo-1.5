Painting with filters

Brightness-contrast: way too slow, paints circles
desaturate: too slow
sharpen: works badly, paints circles -- this used to be okay!
small tiles: makes circles, otherwise effect is fun

Note: make kivio flowchart of what happens when painting with and without filters,
with and without selection, direct or indirect, because I don't follow anymore
