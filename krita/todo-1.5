Bugs

B  119401   ASSI      Action 'change image size' crops source image

Current user interface issues:

* Canvas & dockers change position every time a different tool is selected.
* star tool: the vertices/ration spinners are spaced near the bottom. Ratio should be
  drop down spinbox
* color picker: top combo should be as wide as the whole widget; the widget is a bit too big.,
  we should try to make the listview a lot smaller. Maybe just use labels here?
* contiguous area: options are near bottom of widget
* select similar: options are near bottom of widget
* brush, gradient, pattern buttons: should always be _square_
* Add Palette dialog should have Cancel button (the layout also looks wierd, don't know why)
* The edit palette dialog two-step should be changed into a single dialog
* When splitting and unsplitting (or selecting/unselecting a part layer) all palettes
  except the one with the tool options in it disappear.
* Layer properties dialog: the opacity dropdown is too small (perhaps because
  it's hard-coded for a smaller font?
* Brightness-contrast should have some help text under the curve widget (but it's maybe too late
  for that now.)
* Maybe we should put the filter config widget on the right-hand side of the preview, like
  Digikam does?
* Filters should be re-ordered in less categories
* Custom convolution filter widget layout is iffy
* Simple noise reducer action should have ...
* Wavelet noise reducer action should have ...
* Scripting docker is far too wide when using the platinum widget style
* cubism filter doesn't show the progress bar
* When splitting the view, and adding or removing layers, only one view is updated
* When splitting the view (or adding a part layer -- anything that messes with the view itself) all palettes
  except for the controlbox disappear
  
Regressions:

A Selection mask doesn't show in opengl mode
* setting the opacity with the layerbox slider addes an infinite amount of opacity actions to the undo menu
G cannot move layers up past the their group layer in the layerbox
A Wet & brush paintop options are both shown on top of each other, and on top of the paintop combo when
  painting with a tablent. Also: the option widget very rapidly switches when painting with a tablet.
