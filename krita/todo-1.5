S  * finish basic documentation to cover all of the UI (Sander, you can take
     the full feature list I posted recently as an outline)

Bugs

I'm not saying all these bugs can be fixed for 1.5; but please take a good
hard look at them. We can do without open bugs :-) (Wishlists excepted, but
Cyrille, maybe you're interested in 119290 after the release? sounds like
something that's absolutely your cup of cafe au lait.)
