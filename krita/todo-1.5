Regressions

? saving 16 bit grayscale to jpeg silently converts to 8 bit grayscale
? autocontrast filter on lms crashes
? zooming in leaves display artefacts (see Bart's mail)
? Crash when setting the image colorspace to watercolor -- see CRASHES file.

Painting with filters

? sharpen: works badly, paints circles -- this used to be okay!
? small tiles: makes circles, otherwise effect is fun

Note: make kivio flowchart of what happens when painting with and without filters,
with and without selection, direct or indirect, because I don't follow anymore
