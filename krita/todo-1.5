There are still a couple of LAYERREMOVE's around!

Filters

?  * Fix crashes in filters
R  * Check filters for colorspace problems
R  * Implement warning when using filters that downgrade to another colorspace
R  * Implement filter configuration class

Colorspaces

B  * Implement the last few colorspace dependencies in KisAbstractColorSpace
?  * Implement LAB histogram producers
?  * Optimize colorspace functions at least in 8 and 16 bit rgb where possible
P  * Fix wet colorspace

Core

R  * Fix unittests for colorspaces
P  * Fix part layers
?  * Fix lock in histogram code
?  * Make sure histograms for docker are only calculated when the docker is visible,
     and not on every layer change. Maybe cache histograms for de-activated layers, too?

User interface


B  * Add layer preview to layer box
B  * Add image preview to bird's eyeview box
?  * Use KOffice library guides instead of our own guides
G  * Add GUI to actually group layers
R  * Finish separation plugin to separate to different images
R  * Fix statusbar and put current cursor pos into bird's eyeview docker
A  * Change zoom settings to a percentage everywhere
A  * Zoom the image to fit on loading
A  * Fix display glitches when resizing image or view
R  * Fix the zoom slider as per TZ
?  * Lock all actions when layers are locked or invisible, not just filters
and tools (#90456)
G  * Polish UI of layerbox.
R  * Fix layer menu according to TZ
?  * Fix the color selectors (they are completely broken, details in TZ)
?  * Fix selection handling according to TZ
?  * Make circular (autobrush?) the default brush
?  * Always focus one point of the curve in the curve box so the delete key always
     works. After deleting, focus the most nearby point

Files and Import/Export

C  * Add layer export to tiff export filter. Finish tiff export in general
R  * Finish raw importer
?  * check use of EXIF data (#112727)
?  * Add layer export to magick filter.

Tools

B  * Fix transform tool and re-enable the shear and rotate functionality
?  * Fix crop tool according to Z's hints
R  * add a dummy option widget for tools without an option widget
P  * Add radius option to color picker tool. Fix color picker tool according to TZ
R  * Fix shear tool according to TZ

Plugins

C  * finish, polish and document scripting support
R  * document plugin API

Release

R  * develop thorough test plan and exercise it on several installations
     before release
S  * finish basic documentation to cover all of the UI (Sander, you can take
     the full feature list I posted recently as an outline)

Bugs

I'm not saying all these bugs can be fixed for 1.5; but please take a good
hard look at them. We can do without open bugs :-) (Wishlists excepted, but
Cyrille, maybe you're interested in 119290 after the release? sounds like
something that's absolutely your cup of cafe au lait.)
