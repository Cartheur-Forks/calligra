When doing a new CVS pull, don't forget to edit admin/am_edit (lines
1538--1547) to ensure that HTML documentation is still being built.

This is necessary because Debian asks that documentation be available in
HTML format.

Other patches that need to be applied to the CVS sources are in file
cvs.patch.  From the parent directory, run:

  patch -p0 < debian/cvs.patch
