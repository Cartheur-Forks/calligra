Patches that need to be applied to the CVS sources are in file
cvs.patch in the debian directory.

When doing a new CVS pull, from directory ../ run:

  patch -p0 < debian/cvs.patch

Note also that krita is currently not compiled since libmagick++5-dev
cannot (currently) be simultaneously installed with libqt3-dev.
