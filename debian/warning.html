  <p>
  This version of KOffice is a beta release before version 1.1.
  Most day to day functions will work.  However, there may be crashes.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition the HTML user documentation is completely broken due to a
  transition in the documentation system.  This is why you are reading
  this page now.
  </p>
  <p>
  The main reason for including this version of KOffice at this time is to
  work out packaging problems and non-documentation related bugs.
