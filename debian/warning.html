  <h2>KOffice Development Snapshot</h2>
  </center>
  <p>
  This version of KOffice is a development snapshot between releases 1.0
  and 1.1.  Most day to day functions will work.  However, things like
  filters are incomplete and will (note will, not can) cause crashes.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition the HTML user documentation is completely broken due to a
  transition in the documentation system.  This is why you are reading
  this page now.
  </p>
  <p>
  The main reason for including this version of KOffice at this time is to
  work out packaging problems and non-filter/documentation related bugs.
