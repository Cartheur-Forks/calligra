KDE Office Suite for Debian
---------------------------

Package koffice is a metapackage that depends on the core components of
the KDE Office Suite and suggests the remaining components.

Each application provides documentation in a docbook format that the KDE
Help Centre can display.  For HTML documentation that can be read in any
web browser, see the package koffice-doc-html.
