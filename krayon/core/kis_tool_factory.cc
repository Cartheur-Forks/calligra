 * toolFactory
 *
 * Load every know tool, and make it available to the KisView.  Hopefully, someday
 * these tools will be parts, so we can discover which tools are available at runtime 
 * instead of compile time.
 *
 * The doc becomes the parent of these tools, so you don't need to delete them. When
 * the doc is destroyed, they will get automatically deleted.  In other words, to be 
 * safe, you should store the vector returned by this function inside the parent.  This
 * way, nobody will use this vector after the parent dies.
