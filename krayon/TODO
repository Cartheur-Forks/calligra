Krayon is the KOffice image manipulation application.
It does not aim to be a direct competitor to the GIMP,
but to integrate well with the other KOffice applications,
to be easy to use and yet powerfull.

work towards a 1.0 release that comes with all basic

- basic image manipulation (contrast/brightness/saturation etc.)
- scale images

- basic import/export filters (png/jpg/tif/gif)
- basic plugin filters (blur/sharpen etc.)
- basic image transformations (rotate, mirror)
