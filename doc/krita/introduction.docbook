<title>What is &krita;?</title>
<para>
&krita;, part of &koffice;, can do everything you want with images &mdash; or
it will be able to one day. Everything from photo retouching, image editing,
and last but not least creating original art on your computer as if you were
working with real paint and brushes, pencils, pen and ink. Every day
&krita; becomes a little better, a little more useful.  We are working on it,
anyway. We, that is, Adrian, Bart, Boudewijn, Casper, Cyrille, Michael and Sven.
It could be you, too &mdash; whether you would like to help with some artwork
for the user interface, cool ideas for the todo, helpful bug reports, usability
reviews or even actual code, you will not be snubbed by us.
</para>
<para>
&krita; is as much yours as it is ours. It should be fun, innovative, and
experimental &mdash; first and foremost a pleasure to use and to hack on.

<title>Color management</title>
<para>
One of the most distinguishing features in &krita; is its color management.
If you put two screens side to side, you will notice that there is often a lot
of difference in the way they display colors. Even white, especially white, is
often not the same thing at all. On one screen it can be a dirty yellow, on
another screen a sickly bluish. Very seldom is it a creamy milk-white. The same
holds, unfortunately, for scanners, printers and digital cameras. So, if you
want to see the right colors on screen and on paper, being the colors that you
saw when taking your snapshot, you will have to compensate.
</para>
<para>
&krita; can do this for you: in &krita;, a color is (almost) never just a set of
numbers, one for each color channel; it is a set of numbers with information
attached. And that extra information is contained in a profile: your image has a
profile, your scanner has a profile, your camera should have a profile and your
screen has a profile. When passing information from your image to your screen,
the profiles are checked and the correct color is computed. This may cause a
little slowness, now and then, but the result is that you can work with colors,
instead of almost meaningless RGB triplets.

<title>About this manual</title>
<para>
This manual is not complete. The invitation to join us and help out extends to
the manual, too! We are assuming you have got a good working knowledge of &kde;
and of your operating system. The first chapter will give you a quick tour of
&krita;'s cool features; the other chapters will expand on that information.

<title>About the application author</title>
<para>
Hi! I'm Boudewijn Rempt &mdash; the current maintainer of &krita;. I was
educated as a linguist, retrained as a database developer, work as a Java
hacker, study theology and I have always liked to paint and sketch a little.
Conspiciously absent in my life have been two important things for a developer
of an image app: mathematics and experience with graphic design. That means that
I am probably not the best person to explain the niceties of using an image
editor or a paint application to you. If you catch me in an error, please don't
hesitate to mail me: <email>boud@valdyas.org</email>.
