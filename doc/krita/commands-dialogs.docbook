This dialog is the same as in other &koffice; programs. You can enter various
information about your document here, which will be saved with the document so
that you can retrieve it later to review or edit.
</para>

<para>
On the <guilabel>General</guilabel> tab, you can enter the title, subject and
keywords, as well as an abstract. On the bottom of this tab, some statistical
information is displayed. On the <guilabel>Author</guilabel> tab, you can
store information about yourself. The third tab, <guilabel>User-defined
Metadata</guilabel>, allows you to store any other information.

On this dialog you can a couple of image properties. First of all, the
<guilabel>Name</guilabel> of the image. If you did not set a name earlier
(that can also be done when creating the image), it will have a default name
like <quote>Image1</quote>. Then, you can set its size (determined by the
<guilabel>Width</guilabel> and <guilabel>Height</guilabel> in pixels and
the <guilabel>Resolution</guilabel> in dots per inch) and the color profile to
be used (<guilabel>Profile</guilabel>). Finally, you can fill in the
<guilabel>Description</guilabel> field with any information you want to add to
the image.

This dialog lets you resize your image. In the top part, you can choose the
way the image is resized. If you choose <guilabel>Resize</guilabel>, the size
of the image is changed, but its layers (which contain the actual contents)
will not be modified. So, when you double the height and width of the image,
your original image will occupy the top-left quarter part of your new image.
On decreasing the size of your image, the image layers will stretch out over
the image borders, unless you choose <guilabel>Crop layers on image
resize</guilabel>, which will crop all layers to the new image size.
</para><para>
With <guilabel>Scale</guilabel>, the image layers will be resized with the
image. So increasing the image size will actually enlarge the contents, and
similar for decreasing.
</para><para>
Under <guilabel>Pixel dimensions</guilabel>, you can set which new size you
want the image to have. The original size is given as a reference. The new
size can be set both as pixels or as a percentage, with 100% being the
original size. If you select <guilabel>Constrain proportions</guilabel>, the
new width and height will always be set to the same percentage. For example,
if you have an image of 200 x 100 pixels, and set the width to 20 pixels, the
height will automatically be changed to 10. With this checkbox unselected, you
can also resize the image non-proportionally.

With this dialog, you can rotate the image. The top part of the dialog shows
the result of the rotation in the form of a change in dimension (if any) and
visual feedback. Under <guilabel>Direction</guilabel> you can choose between 
rotating clockwise and counter-clockwise. Under <guilabel>Angle</guilabel>,
you can set the amount of rotation. 90, 180 and 270 degrees can be selected
using the respective option button, other amounts need to be specified with
the <guilabel>Custom</guilabel> spin box.

<para>
This dialog allows you to shear your image. By shearing, the bounding
rectangle of your image is transformed into a parallellogram. One pixel
row/column is kept in place, the next one is shifted by a certain amount, the
next one by the same amount relative to the previous one, etcetera.
The X and Y shearing angles can be set using the two spin boxes.

<para>
With this dialog, you can separate (part of) your image. Every color component
(channel) will be put into a separate layer or image. At the top of the dialog, the current color model is shown. Below that, a couple of options can be set.
</para>
<para>
Under <guilabel>Source</guilabel>, you can choose what part of the image to
separate. The three options are <guilabel>Current layer</guilabel>, which
(obviously) only uses the currently selected layer, <guilabel>Flatten all
layers before separation</guilabel>, which uses the entire image, and
<guilabel>Flatten all visible layers before separation</guilabel>, which uses
all visible layers.
</para>
<para>
Under <guilabel>Output</guilabel>, you can choose where the result of the
separation should be written to: either to a couple of layers, or to a couple
of images.
</para>
<para>
Under <guilabel>Alpha Options</guilabel>, you can choose what should be done
with the alpha channel of the selected layer(s). It can be copied to each new
channel, be discarded, or separated on its own.
</para>
<para>
The two options at the bottom of the dialog, finally, determine whether the
source should be downscaled to 8 bit colors (if it contains more), and if the
output should be in color (default is to separate the channels to grayscale
values).
</para>

<para>
This dialog allows you to convert your image from one color space to another.
The <guilabel>Target color space</guilabel> and <guilabel>Destination ICM
profile</guilabel> are used to set to which colorspace and profile the image
will be converted. You can influence how this conversion is done with the
<guilabel>Rendering Intent</guilabel> option.
</para>
<para>
With <guilabel>Perceptual</guilabel> conversion, the source color space is
mapped linearly to the destination color space. If the destination color space
<quote>accepts</quote> a lesser color range than the source, shifts may occur
because the range is compressed. <guilabel>Relative colorimetric</guilabel>
conversion converts every color to the closest color in the destination color
space. This may mean that a certain color range is mapped to one color in the
destination color space. <guilabel>Saturation</guilabel> means that fully
saturated colors will remain fully saturated, even if this means that the
actual color is changed. With <guilabel>Absolute colorimetric</guilabel>
conversion, the same approach is used as with <guilabel>Relative
colorimetric</guilabel>, but the white point of the color space (the value
designating the color white) is not changed to match the new color space,
which may result in unwanted changes to near colors.
