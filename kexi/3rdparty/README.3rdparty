Kexi 3rdparty directory contents
--------------------------------

Purpose: Any kexi-independent code goes here.

kexisql/ - database engine implementation taken "as-is" from SQLite project (www.sqlite.org)
           We use kexisql name for indication that original SQLite sources can be changed
	   by Kexi programmers from-version-to-version without notice. "original"
	   SQLite db implementation library won't be in conflict with kexisql lib 
	   (we use other naming).
