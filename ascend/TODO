Reimplement initDoc() to get rid of the template dialog,
  try just calling initEmpty() from there.

Provide your own rc file in WUView with setXMLFile()
  In that file, define a big toolbar (see kdelibs/kdeui/kpartgui.dtd
   for the attributes to use, like iconSize, position etc.)

If you want to get rid of the mainwindow actions, this is going to be more tricky :)
  Maybe just hide the menubar using mainWindow()->menuBar()->hide().
